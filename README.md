ABSTRACT 
       

  
  Diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease using Machine learning has helped in predicting and diagnosing
the diseases, and this project aims to leverage this technology to develop a web application that predicts the risk of
diabetes,high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The application will provide users with an intuitive interface to
input their health data, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipid profile. The machine learning models used in the application will be trained on a large dataset of health records and will use a
variety of features to predict the risk of each disease and provide suitable diagnosis in the further more records

OBJECTIVE 

  We can determine the prediction and diagnosis of Daibetes, Blood Pressure and Heart Disease using an application
which gets input from the user such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting glucose, and
overall health data profile. The machine learning models used in the application will be trained on a large data set of
health records and will use a variety of features to predict the risk of each disease. The application will provide users
with a clear and easy-to-understand prediction of their disease risk and will also provide recommendations for
lifestyle changes that may help reduce their risk. The application will be tested on a sample populations to validate
its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting
